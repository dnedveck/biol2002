There's going to be more information on the datasets eventually ...

These datasets can be found in `???/shared/???`

I think they are all 16S data, so you will only be able to answer questions based on measures of species diversity. 

### AMP -- Rural African Human Gut Microbiota

Different categories are:
- sex
- age
- BMI
- location
- diet
- ancestry
- parasitism level


### JMMP -- Japanese Macaque gut microbiota

- Season
- anthelmintic treatment
- age

### UGHP -- gut microbiota from HIV infected individuals

### Yatsunenko -- human gut microbiota

### Forensic -- skin and keyboard microbiome

uhh ... matching fingertip microbiome to swabs from a keyboard?

### Cancer

we got data on something to do with colon cancer. Maybe it's whole genome data?
