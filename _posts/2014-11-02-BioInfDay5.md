[Here's the slides for this lab](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zA0PnfacTWFn5eF38CmV6ITOIC8RmejOpbgm_wADbdY/edit?usp=sharing). They should help you understand what is going on.

In the beginning we discussed the Human Microbiome 2012 paper. 
MSI was being difficult, so we spent the majority of the time on the Babynames assingment in R.
